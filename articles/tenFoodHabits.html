					<h1>Ten Food Habbits</h1>
					
					<h3>i. Eat slowly; chew your food well</h3> 
					<p>It <img  class="left" src="../img/articles/a5.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					takes 20 minutes before your stomach sends a clear message to your brain that you're full. If you take the time to chew your food 
					well, you will find you end up eating less. Ideally, you should have smaller, frequent meals as opposed to larger, infrequent ones.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>ii. Eat more</h3>
					<p>If  <img  class="right" src="../img/articles/a2.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					you want to lose weight, starving yourself does not help -- you need to eat well. When your body doesn't receive the required nutrients,
					your metabolism slows down. Metabolism is the rate at which you burn calories while resting. So, if you don't eat enough, fewer calories
					will be burnt and there will be less fat loss. You should eat small meals at regular intervals to keep your energy levels high.
					Eat till you 	are satiated (at the same time, don't forget what we suggested in Tip No 1).
					</p> <div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>iii. Eat less red meat</h3>
					<p>
					Red meats are high in saturated fat and should be avoided by people with high cholesterol. Chicken and fish are the best meats to 
					consume. Fish is better than chicken because it has antioxidants. Antioxidants are organic substances that include vitamins C, E, A and
					carotenoids; carotenoids add pigment to some fruits and vegetables. For instance, carrots wouldn't be orange without them. 
					Beta-carotenoid is the most popular of carotenoids. Antioxidants help prevent cancer, heart disease and stroke. These meats can be 
					baked, grilled or roasted. Frying will add unnecessary fat.
					</p> <div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>iv. Prevent constipation</h3> 
					<p>Add <img  class="left" src="../img/articles/d1.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					fibre to your diet; this adds bulk to your food and prevents constipation. Whole grain foods like oatmeal, bran, wheat germ, brown rice, 
					fruits (especially with their skin), prunes (dried plums), etc, are all good sources of fibre. Home remedies for constipation including the following:
					</p> <div class="clear"></div>
					<ul>
						<li> Have guavas with the seeds.</li>
						<li> Have honey in a glass of milk twice a day.</li>
						<li> Have one tablespoon of corn syrup in a glass of water.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p>Corn syrup is actually corn starch, which is primarily glucose. It is used in making candies, jams and jellies because it does not 
					crystallise like sugar. Corn syrup is available in any well-stocked supermarket.</p>
					</p> <div class="clear"></div>
					
					<h3>v. Have onion and garlic</h3>
					<p>
					Onion decreases blood pressure and garlic decreases cholesterol. Any amount and form of onion and garlic will give you the benefits 
					of their properties, but a raw garlic clove taken on an empty stomach in the morning is the best.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>vi. Use less salt in your cooking</h3> 
					<p>Use <img  class="left" src="../img/articles/d2.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					minimum amount of salt for cooking if you have high blood pressure. Salt also causes water retention. This means your body will 
					retain water if it is not receiving enough. After all, it still has to carry on the normal functioning of the organs and, if you are not drinking
					enough H2O, then the body starts keeping it. 
					Water being taken in other forms, such as, soups, dals, drinks, etc, is retained for later use. Bloating and puffiness are all signs of water retention.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>vii. Have calcium-rich foods</h3>
					<p>Use<img  class="right" src="../img/articles/d3.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					skimmed or double-toned milk and milk products as these contain less fat. Double-toned milk has lesser fat than toned or full
					cream milk. In the non-packaged variety, cow's milk is just as good as skimmed milk; it is definitely better than buffaloes' milk as the 
					latter contains large amounts of fat. You should have between one and two glasses of milk a day. Other sources of calcium and protein
					can be taken instead of milk, if one is allergic to it. Calcium rich foods include almonds, figs, red kidney beans (rajma), mustard greens
					(sarson ka saag), etc. Proteins can be found in meats, sprouts, soya, dals, etc.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>viii. Switch from maida to whole grains</h3>
					<p>Replace<img  class="left" src="../img/articles/d5.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					maida products with whole grains, whole wheat, soya breads, etc, as these have a good amount of fibre; fibre helps in binding
					cholesterol, which helps in less production of bad cholesterol. Whole grain foods like oatmeal, bran, wheat germ and brown rice, fruits, 
					especially with skins, prunes, etc, are all good sources of fibre. Too much fibre may cause loose stools, so you have to monitor your 
					individual intake accordingly. Medically, approximately 25 gm of fibre a day is enough to help maintain your digestive system. 
					A good indicator: four slices of brown bread contains five grams of fibre; so does one large banana or orange.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>ix. Have foods that contain iron</h3>
					<p>
					These include red meats, especially liver, fruits like watermelon and pomegranate, vegetables like spinach, beans, beets and broccoli,
					whole grains, dried fruits, especially prunes, sunflower seeds, etc.
					</p> <div class="clear"></div>

					<h3>x. Relish the flavours</h3>
					<p>You<img  class="left" src="../img/articles/d4.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt=""/>
					may have heard some of these before. But the best good food habit, which we all seem to overlook, is to actually taste and enjoy
					the flavours of the food with your emotions instead of just your tongue.
