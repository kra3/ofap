					<h1>Processed foods</h1>
					<p>
					Since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> 
					some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technologies</a>
					that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used
					to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These
					latter technologies include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurisation" title="Pasteurisation">pasteurisation</a>, 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclavation" title="Autoclavation">autoclavation</a>, 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying" title="Drying">drying</a>,
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting" title="Salting">salting</a>,and separation of various components,
					and all appear to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no 
					doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food 
					processing technologies undoubtedly have downfalls as well.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>
					
					<p>
					Modern separation techniques such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling" title="Milling">milling</a>, 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation" title="Centrifugation">centrifugation</a>, 
					and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressing" title="Pressing" class="mw-redirect">pressing</a> have enabled
					concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino
					acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain
					nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as 
					certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet to be discovered substances. Because of reduced nutritional value,
					processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were
					lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, 
					regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>
					/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a>, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids.
					In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>
					
					<p>
					A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beri-beri" title="Beri-beri">beri-beri</a> in people 
					subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine" title="Thiamine">thiamine</a>, causing beri-beri. Another example
					is the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>
					among infants in the late 1800s in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been
					heat-treated (as suggested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur" title="Pasteur">Pasteur</a>) to control bacterial
					disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.
					</p><div class="clear"></div>
					
					<p>
					As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that
					the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food 
					processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g. nutritional recommendations,
					agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap
					foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable
					to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive but nutritionally 
					superior whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more
					convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing
					throughout the world along with many nutrition-related healthcomplications.
